# ICDFA Digital Forensics Labs

This repository contains hands‑on laboratory work completed as part of the  
**Advanced Cybercrime Investigation** program at the  
**International Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics Academy (ICDFA)**.

The labs focus on practical digital forensics fundamentals, low‑level data analysis,
disk and partition interpretation, Linux command‑line usage, and evidence integrity.

This repository is structured to reflect how real digital forensics lab work is
documented, preserved, and reviewed.
